# Role & Project Responsibilities

This section outlines my responsibilities in delivering data analytics, automation, and monitoring solutions to support operational reliability and system performance.

## Project 1 : Mitsubishi Fuso CCP

### Project Work Overview

- Designed and implemented a zero copy data pipeline integrating Salesforce Data Cloud with Azure Databricks, enabling analytics access in Salesforce while data remained governed within Databricks; used SQL and advanced analytics to analyse integrated datasets.
- Developed interactive dashboards using Salesforce Analytics Studio to visualise event logs, user engagement, and system activity, supporting performance monitoring and anomaly detection.
- Implemented scalable data ingestion and file upload workflows using Salesforce Bulk API and Azure Blob Storage, applying configuration management to ensure secure and consistent handling of large data volumes across development, testing, and production.
- Implemented Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for Salesforce applications and enabled token based access across integrated systems, supporting secure authentication and authorisation for data and service integrations.
- Managed Git/GitHub repositories and CI/CD workflows, including branching, pull requests, code reviews, and production releases; integrated SonarQube for automated code quality analysis.
- Coordinated testing and release activities, including functional validation, non-functional requirements (NFR), performance testing, and concurrent load testing, supervising execution across teams.
- Conducted a client focused case study on Salesforce Data Cloud and Agentforce, mapping data driven service automation use cases to improve customer support and issue resolution.


## Project 2 : Mobily Automation

### Project Work Overview
- Collaborated with cross functional teams to gather requirements and produce Business Requirements Documents (BRDs), delivery timelines, and CI/CD architecture diagrams, translating business needs into a complete release solution.
- Designed the end to end CI/CD workflow, defining build, test, and deployment stages based on client and system constraints; initially validated the approach using open source tools (GitHub, Jenkins) before implementing the final solution with Jira, Bitbucket, Bamboo, and shell scripting.
- Implemented webhook triggered CI/CD pipelines driven by Jira workflow status transitions, along with automated email alerts for pipeline failures (including error details and logs), to enable controlled, traceable releases and faster issue resolution.
- Integrated CI/CD pipelines with external servers and systems using secure SSH based script execution and REST API calls to trigger automated tasks and system integrations.
- Supported release validation by assisting with test case execution, troubleshooting pipeline issues, and guiding team members on CI/CD workflows and issue resolution during release cycles.
- Automated end to end release processes, reducing manual effort by approximately 40%, minimising human error, and ensuring consistent execution through standardised pipelines, logging, and alerting.

## Project 1 : Mitsubishi Fuso COC

### Project Work Overview

- Designed Salesforce data models and validation rules, establishing a reliable data foundation for reporting and analysis.
- Developed SOQL and Apex based backend logic to generate time based operational trends in job volumes and processing times, providing clear workload visibility.
- Implemented duration and status based calculations to identify long running cases early, supporting timely escalation and effective issue resolution.
- Applied Git/GitHub version control practices, managing branches, pull requests, and merge conflict resolution during development and release cycles.
- Executed deployments across development, testing, and production environments using Apache Ant migration tools, supporting controlled and repeatable releases.
