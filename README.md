## 👨‍💻 About Me

I build and operate **data driven systems** with a focus on reliability, automation, and production readiness. My experience spans **data pipelines, analytics platforms, cloud based integration, and CI/CD workflows**, where I enjoy turning raw data into systems that can be monitored, scaled, and trusted in real world environments.

I am currently pursuing a **Master’s in Machine Learning and Mathematical Modelling**, strengthening my foundation in applied machine learning, statistical modelling, and MLOps concepts. My long term interest lies in working at the intersection of **data engineering and machine learning**, contributing to practical, production ready solutions rather than purely experimental code.

---

## What I’m Currently Working On

- Strengthening fundamentals in **machine learning, statistical modelling, and optimisation**
- Building **end to end ML workflows** using Python (data preparation → modelling → evaluation)
- Learning **MLOps concepts** such as model versioning, monitoring, and deployment patterns
- Applying **cloud and automation principles** to data and ML pipelines
- Improving code quality, reproducibility, and experiment tracking

---

##  Technical Focus Areas

- **Data Engineering:** Data pipelines, integration patterns, analytics ready data models  
- **Analytics & Monitoring:** SQL based analysis, dashboards, operational metrics  
- **Cloud & Automation:** CI/CD workflows, containerisation, cloud platforms  
- **Machine Learning (Learning & Applied):** scikit-learn, PyTorch, model evaluation, MLOps concepts
