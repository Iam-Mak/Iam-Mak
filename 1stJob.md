## Maintenance Metrics & Analytical Approach

This section presents the maintenance metrics used to evaluate reliability, reduce downtime, and support maintenance decisions.

### Key Metrics Tracked
- **Breakdown Frequency** – how often equipment failures occurred over a defined period  
- **Downtime Hours** – total production time lost due to breakdowns  
- **Equipment Availability (%)** – percentage of scheduled time machines were operational  
- **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)** – average time required to restore equipment after a failure  
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** – average operating time between consecutive failures  
- **Preventive Maintenance Adherence** – extent to which maintenance activities followed planned schedules  

### Analytical Use of Metrics
- Metrics were reviewed on a weekly basis to identify trends rather than isolated incidents.  
- Higher breakdown frequency was treated as an indicator of increased reliability risk.  
- Rising downtime levels highlighted gaps in maintenance prioritization or preventive coverage.  
- Equipment availability was used as a summary indicator of overall maintenance effectiveness.

### Decision Support Using Metrics
- Trend analysis was used to prioritize preventive maintenance activities.  
- Machines showing early warning signs were selected for short duration preventive maintenance to reduce the risk of major failures.  
- Metric trends were reviewed to assess whether corrective and preventive actions were improving reliability over time.
